# AI-Generated-Synthetic-Images-Differentiation
## COMP 576 Final Project
### Efe Eboreime, Steve Hudgson, Weixiao Liao, and Minh Nguyen


#### Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a system or methodology that can accurately identify images generated by AI, such as those created by DALL-E, GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), or other similar technologies. This involves understanding the nuances and characteristics of AI-generated images and using these insights to differentiate them from naturally captured or traditionally created images.

#### Methodology

- Dataset: CIFAKE
- Methods
  - Customs CNN
  - ResNet-50
- Testing and Evaluation

#### Usage

The code can be run directly from the `cifake_cnn_v2.ipynb` notebook.
